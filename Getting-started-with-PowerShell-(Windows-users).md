## Windows PowerShell

Previous versions of Windows have relied on Linux-like environments that don't run native linux (i.e. they don't play nice with many programs). Windows 10 introduced the PowerShell, which is an easy way to get started if you've never used command line before. We recommend not using previous versions of Windows due to the unpredictable nature of those clients. Please be sure your system has all the latest updates before getting started.

To start PowerShell, open the app by right clicking and choose "run as administrator". This should open the shell, but if there are difficulties, the official [Microsoft documentation for getting started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started?view=powershell-7.2) may be helpful.

## Alternatives

Alternatively, [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) is a Windows client that can be downloaded to run terminal in a highly customizable environment.
